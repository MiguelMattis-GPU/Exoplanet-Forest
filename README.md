# Exoplanet-Forest in Python
The data we decided to work with is Kepler mission data acquired by NASA.
We are sure of its reliability since NASA has used this same data to make large investments on future missions that recieved millions of dollars in funding.
The premise of this project was to implement the various data analysis tools and concepts that a data scientist would use when searching for a certain data input with various parameters.
This project involves Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Standard Scalers, Decision Tree Regressors, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifiers, and more.
